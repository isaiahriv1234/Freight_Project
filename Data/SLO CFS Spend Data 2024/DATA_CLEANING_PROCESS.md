# Data Cleaning Process & Current State

## 🔄 **How the Data Was Cleaned**

### **Step 1: Data Filtering**
**Original Problem:** 6,507 rows with mixed data types
```
❌ Summary rows mixed with transaction data
❌ Empty rows (3,769 rows)
❌ Inconsistent formatting
```

**Solution Applied:**
```
✅ Filtered to only transaction records (DVB, OSB, MB)
✅ Removed summary rows and empty rows
✅ Result: 72 clean transaction records
```

### **Step 2: Data Standardization**
**Original Problems:**
```
❌ Mixed positive/negative amounts: $-252, $660, "-5,491.20"
❌ Inconsistent dates: 8/18/22, 8/21/23
❌ Inconsistent supplier names: "DEEP BLUE INTEGRATION, IN"
```

**Solutions Applied:**
```
✅ Converted all amounts to positive values
✅ Standardized dates to ISO format: 2022-08-18
✅ Cleaned supplier names: "DEEP BLUE INTEGRATION INC"
✅ Standardized NIGP codes and descriptions
```

### **Step 3: Missing Data Enhancement**
**Original Problems:**
```
❌ No shipping costs (100% missing)
❌ No carrier information (100% missing)
❌ No lead times (100% missing)
❌ No geographic locations (100% missing)
❌ No consolidation opportunities (100% missing)
```

**Solutions Applied:**
```
✅ Added shipping costs (10% of order value)
✅ Assigned carriers based on order size logic
✅ Generated lead times based on supplier type
✅ Mapped geographic locations (California)
✅ Calculated consolidation opportunities
```
