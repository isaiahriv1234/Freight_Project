# Project Overview
This project challenges participants to develop an AI-powered system to optimize shipping costs and enhance supplier diversity for Cal Poly's procurement operations. The system will analyze historical purchasing data, shipping rates from major carriers, and supplier diversity information to recommend cost-effective shipping solutions while helping meet the university's 25% supplier diversity goal.
